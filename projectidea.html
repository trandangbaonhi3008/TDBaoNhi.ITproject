                      In my opinion, communication between human and human or human and computer is equally important, since modern life have strong connection with technology in every daily aspects.
                      As a result, the ability to make technological application in helping us to improve our life quality is a desired goal. As a matter of fact, machine and computer are now replacing human’ work force in production and manufacturing market, but idea is that I really passionate about making computer application becoming more friendly and dearly to people.

                      Nowadays, people in different ages that range from 10 to 60 years old have at least one automobile devices such as mobile phone, tablet or personal computers, so apps and programing facilities is not strange to modern society at all. According to the Guardian, the report say that many people spend more than 3 hours on their phones doing different types of activities.
                      As an inevitable consequence, we think that we are closer to each other day by day through catting conversation, sharing on social media, but we are now lonely than ever.
                  <p>
                      Many issues have been risen in 4.0 industry such as extension of generation gaps, suicide, violence, cyber bullying, cyber crimes and other hot issues out there. If we spend that much time on the phone just to take the depression, loneliness and mental disorder, why don’t we invent and remake the internet of things and technology, something that could help to improve us not only about physical advantages but also about mental improving and alleviating devices to make us happier, less isolated.
                  </p>
                  That is my concern on how to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve human being mental health.</p>

                                      The project will help me a lot in gaining experience for my future career. The first one is about knowledge of human psychology. Since I have to read a quite huge amount of books about the topic to find resources and database for my app.

                                      Secondly, the ability to know a high level programming language like Swift or Python is a good chance to develop coding skills and logical thinking, then apply the thing I learnt in computer to reality is to make such impact to other life.
                                      If the app is a success, the effectiveness of communication is achieved, which is a very important skills of Business Analyst main roles, to make impact on the internal department and external factors like clients, I can know a great deal of customer behavior and experience through the reviewing section of the app.

                                  The psychiatric disorders among Vietnamese and Asian is getting higher and higher yearly, with 30% of the population suffer depression and other mental disorder diseases.
                                  According to many reports and statistics from WHO and other well-being organizations, Asian teenagers often found to suffer mental disorders which is the inevitable of stressful education, family problems, bad relationships and being bullied at school.
                                  They do not have many friends and close-knit relationship, they rarely can talk to anyone when they desperate for a sharing conversation. Therefore, the idea of spreading the love and care for teenagers who are also in the same age of mine, give something that will make others life better, and heal their inner pain.

                              You can also decide the name of Beisy in the setting mode, virtual companion, and choose a photo of him or her to go along with a customizable profile.
                              Therefore, Beisy  is not a pure programmed app since she can be everyone you wish to talk to, such as your crush, your adoslence friend or any kind of person who you want to be in contact with.

                                  The app will receive and store all the message in the cloud storage and then transfer them to the analysis programmed code to process the next step that is dealing with data.
                                  After the classificing process by using Naive Bayes method,it is a “ probabilistic classifier and can learn the pattern of examining a set of documents that has been categorized”. The semantic analysis is derived from database where each associated term connects to each other. Then the program will examine their relationship in the ontology.
                                  Finally the most important part is stored documents and examine the similarity of words in the same catergorized class that is related to these topics “ depression” “sorrow” sad” and “suicide”.

                                  I really hope that the project will be successful so it can help to solve social issue like what I have mentioned above.
                                  The impact of Beisy in user life will be a positive one, beside from that all of the feature I have mentioned is just a primary base for Beisy, my ambition for Beisy is to make one mental health better and connect them to a person who encounter the similar problem, therefore they can be soulmate and have a friend in real life as well. 
                                  However, the first goal for my app is to complete it and fixing all the possible bug.
