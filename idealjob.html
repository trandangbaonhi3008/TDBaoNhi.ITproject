                        <p>
                            The main reason why I want to be a Business Analyst is that I always put the measurement of how success my work is through the improvement of company’s productivity, client’s needs and the process of achieving targeted goal. Therefore, during the process of creating, producing and improving the final product, whether it comes to the relationship of a functionality of a specific product or to the internal operations of the production team, I always think of how many people will benefit from the innovative things that I did.
                            <br />
                            I strongly believe that making a product or an application that have more efficient allows me to interact with the product team helpfully and internally to get the job done and spread my impacts beyond the inner affection, as a final result that is to reach clients who benefit from the product and work with it on a daily basis.

                            The second reason is that communication and documentations is key concept for Business Analyst IT. My personality, as an extrovert who always carving for the chance this role gives me to work with people from not only different departments in the company who possess variety of great expertise knowledge, and creativity. This career provides an environment in which employee should continuously work together and make collaboration with developers, testers, client services representatives to get the job done, which allowed me to leverage my communication skills and to learn about each department's role and value to the company.
                            <br />
                            Some people see frequent communication as way to create stress, anxiety and depression. However, as an ENTJ- person I can easily transmit anxiety and deal with these mental health issues. I can take advantages from communication ad a way which create a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together and improve self-reliability and ability.

                                    As a girl with nature to be a leader I always searching for chance to improve my ability in helping other and fulfil their needs, or in other words I can become the driving brain:
                                    One of the very interesting aspects of a business analyst's job is understanding the core need of the clients and working with the development team to fulfil that requirement by creating a value and practical solutions to the need.

                                <li>Therefore, the idea of being a part in developing something that people are in need of, and that makes their lives and work much better, encourages me to always doing my best to bring value both to company and customer.</li>

                                    The final reason which can be seen as a challenge also is that Business Analyst is the who have to always be open-minded, active, assertive, learn, adjust and improve.
