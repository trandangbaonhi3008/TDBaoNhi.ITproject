            <p>
                My interest in IT is machine learning and data science, the relationship of business and information system.
                My passion for AI started when I came across the course about Artificial Intelligence which is offered by Microsoft and MITx. Both of the courses provide medium range of knowledge about this fascinating area of modern Information Technology. My particular interest of the big picture of AI is natural language processing, which is one of branches of Deep Learning. Since then the idea of making more research and gaining information about NLP and Semantic Analysis is always burning in my heart, I am passionate about making such impact on social issue by using the application of deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. The one who inspire me in my passion is Doctor Lex Fridman one of lecturer in Deep Learning video course from MIT.
                However, I was once major in literature so I don’t have any related experience in Information Technology field.
                I ‘m eager to learn and gain both experience and knowledge during the time I study at RMIT. .

                        <p>
                            The first reason that suddenly jumps out of line is the international environment, which is one of the most attractive traits of the school itself. As a young and curious girl, I knew RMIT for a very long time, back then it was the time I was in grade 8, when I first saw some fascinating articles about the school.
                            It was an introduction about how amazing the school is, with a lot of modern facilities and professional education style, all of the courses are taught in English and many others interesting things. Since then RMIT has stayed in my mind, and the idea of having a slot to study in this amazing school always haunted me. I have to mention the word haunted since I had always been thinking about RMIT when someone asked me about my future university.
                            This will be a very convenient environment for me to improve my English skill and other soft skills to well-prepared for my career path.

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row align-items-center mb-80">
                <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6">
                    <div class="section_title">
                        
                        <h4 style="text-align:center"><i><strong>Second reason</strong></i></h4>
                        <p>
                            The second reason for my decision to register in RMIT is about the program. 
                            I did a research about the program structure and found more detail information about all the course which will be taught in Information Technology, even though it is not perfect, but it just fits me in the comfortable way. The program has a good combination of practical and theorical, in which can provide students with skills and knowledge during the academic years. 
                            To confirm my thought, which is lack of the industry and real world data, I also consulted my uncle and brother whose jobs are IT professional about IT program at RMIT, and both told me that I had made a good choice.
                            I really hope that I can blend myself well in this course to absorb the quintessence.

                        <p>
                            The last reason is the exchange opportunity with many prestigious universities in the world that are in the partnership program with RMIT.
                            I can have many choose to study abroad by program offered by RMIT university like study a short course abroad, go overseas for one or two semesters and study at one of  200+ partner universities, or even I can transfer permanently to RMIT in Australia
                            I always crave for a chance to study abroad, maybe in Melbourne or somewhere else.
                            I have not decided yet, but I can select a few notice universities such as Technical University of Munich, Lund University or Katherholic University of Leauven. The chance to explore other countries and cultures.

                    Beside from that, the in-depth information about cloud storage, security in information and computers, web design and information system are all my want-to know areas to become an expert in my future career. 
                    The most important outcomes I think I can gain through university life is the ability to manage IT projects to maximize my productivity in the team.  </p>
                    <p>The second expectation is to how to apply what I have learnt including theories and skills to large-scale software application developments with the effectiveness of being a team member or individual, the cooperative collaboration work and way to resolution techniques of solving potential conflicts.
