                                <br />
                                With an innate confidence that brings out the important role, I could take a great deal of amusement and fame in helping, guiding others to work together, to both improve themselves or a team. I’m harass to strong personalities and beam authenticity, concerns and benevolence.
                                <br />
                                It is a gratification to me whenever I can connect with everyone, I can proudly say that I have proper communication skills which help me to build a relationship or networking with many different people regardless of their characteristics, raw feeling and mind set. To be honest, I’m good at reflecting myself as well which help me quite a lot in transmitting anxiety and dealing with stress.  
                                <br />
                                I have good self-awareness but it is not my nature, it have been a long journey and I have suffered many failures to learn and explore more about myself. My confidence is not really good back when I was in high school due to light psychological issues and depression I had.
                                <br />
                                Well, this one is quite interesting personal traits of me but don’t be surprise why I can give you a tissue when you still act as normal, since I can know people’s feeling without communicate to them, it was easily to realize the emotion of human by psychological body reading.  
                                <br />
                                My belief is the rule of giving and receiving or another word: Karma. It is obvious that you pay for your action, even if you did something with strong emotions you are expected to face with the consequence. 
                                <br />
                                I can confidently speak in a public space or to speak out when I think something that needed to be said. In addition, I’m a kind of person who learn through experience and conversation, in other words, talking with people who possess knowledge or experience is my hobby.  
                                As the one who have good, optimistic vision and strong personality, I am often nominated by other to take the leadership roles.

                <p>
                    From the test result above and the fingers print analytic, my best learning ability can be explored through learning. As a matter of fact, I can feel that my ears are more sensitive than other senses, since my doctor say that the sensitivity of my ears is quite higher than the average.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my experience, I can say that by listening or watching video from many valid sources and the face-to-face conversation is a better choice for more quick learning and the transmisson of knowledge is more effectively.
                    My concentration is often affected by environment volume and noise, I can’t focus on my task with the existence of loud sound, it is so distracting that I can’t even know what I had been doing.  

                    Other fun fact, I love listening to song and hearing people conversation in the morning, but often see them as annoying stuffs at the end of the day.

                    <h2>EQ test result</h2>
                    <p>According to the test and the feed back I got from my relationships, I have a great sense of emotional intelligence, good sense of communicating and high sympathetic ability. With healthy sense of self-awareness, I can easily realize my strength and weakness, be able to recognize, describe my thoughts and emotions that are leading me to the action in which I made or will do, in such a case making a necessary change is important before any consequence happens. Be able to understand not only my emotions but also other feeling and thoughts is helping me a lot when dealing and interacting with my contact, since I know what needed to be said and what to avoid in order to prevent argument  from happening, which will lead to the destruction of relationship further.  

                    <strong>Relationship viewpoints from the test and self-experience: </strong>

In any kind of relationship, my priority towards people are sincerity, mindfulness and compassion because I think that love, sympathy have the infinite power to make one’s life change. The relationship that is treated with those characters is stable, unstressful and make one feel comfortable when thinking of. When I come into contact with someone, I often see that person as good and well-intentioned, I focus on how they act and their speech of thoughts, experiences to know other viewpoints and behaviors. It was a long journey to my current emotional intelligence, since I can’t be this good without mediation, which helps me a lot in knowing clearly every aspect inside myself.  

I am flexible and positive in work and life changing circumstances, since I find out that life is an unexpected journey which full of ups and downs, and things change constantly. As a result, I am optimistic in the face of challenging circumstances, focus on opportunities rather than obstacles and feel hopeful when looking forward future. 
                                                                                                                <strong>EQ weaknesses</strong>

Concentrating on shortcoming can be exhausting and depressing to me sometimes, my mood often fluctuated at the beginning of failure stages, in which all of my effort drained. Since when trying to do something I put all of my energy and effort to achieve it, although I expected bad situation can be happen when they did, I just can’t avoid the disappointment and doubt about myself. I put pressure on my shoulder for not trying enough, even though this time will pass quickly, sometimes it is not something unnecessary ruined in mood.                                                                                                               </p>

                <p>
                    Being a flexible, energetic and active person, I can diverse myself to many different roles and communicate deeply with other people. I can blend easily in the new environment and quite successfully catch their impression.
                    My roles in many team-work is often a leader, I am always positive in many situations, mostly in hardships which mean that I am looking forward to the better future and focus on the improvement, not to regret about failure or be unmotivated, as a final result is the improvement of the team day by day, especially during downside time.
                    As a team, effective communication is an essential key to meet the goal, and I think that the ability to listening and understanding each other as a team is part of good communication. 
                    Being a auditory learner, I can confidently say that I’m a patient listener who is always stay calm and receptively receive feedback for the improvement.   
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>My role in a team is a task provider and team supporter. Therefore, I am the one who can solve inner-team problem well, and make people work effectively as a team. I would like to work with people who have interesting idea and dare to take the challenges, so when it comes to form a team, I think that my abilities to cooperate, tolerate and socialize can make it easy for me to relate to my teammates. 
                With the high sensitivity I can understand my teammates needs and wants, or their emotional status, so if anything is the burn-catching material for internal argument or disagreement in task delivery, I can solve it beforehand.  </p>
            </div>


            <div class="col-md-12 mr-auto" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="">
                <h2 class="mb-4 section-title" style="background-color: aliceblue;text-align:center"><strong> My weaknesses </strong> </h2>
                
                <p>
                    But as a matter of fact, I found myself as an idealist that means I want all the things done perfectly without mistake and set high expectation for whom I love. This type of thing cannot occur in real life since many accidences come when we don’t expect them to happen. 
                    For instance, in the project development state each person have their own section to work, but in the reflection and combining state, some of the section is just meet the normal standard when it can be improved to be even much better.
                    The problem is the one who take the responsibility for that section don’t want to hear feedback, only to keep his/her current work, as a team member or leader who always carving for perfection, I would vent and often express them aggressively, and that will lead to conflict or disagreement in a team.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Being sensitive and helpful can sometime cause the dependence of people, since I often do other people work in order to meet deadline without destroying the relationship, especially for those I really appreciate. The fact is that it is hard when it comes to the situation of making decision between relationship or work, sometime my hesitation lead to all lose result.
                With me, making tough decision is a real challenge that I am current struggle with.Being the one with good vision can be harmed by paralysis, imagination about all the bad results of my action, especially if they are humanitarian.
                Finally, I often find myself uncomfortably living in such a noisy environment, and if in the team meeting takes place not absolute place, thne I will be distracted and annoyed, and my attributes can affect my teammate as well.</p>

I would like to work with people who are logical thinking group, less talkative because this opposite trait can give a well- balanced environment in a group work.  I know I have high expectation for the result and often begin the assignment way sooner than others, so in order to prevent conflict happen, I will looking for someone who also have the same target with me, and also set high priority for their study.  Finally, with a high sensitivity, I think it would be perfect if my teammate is thoughtful and nice, even though everyone is well-intentioned, sometimes it can be hurt when people actually just purely work without understanding communication like sincere group reflection or feedback. </p>
